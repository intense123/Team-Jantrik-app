HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY We build a system to learn the young generation about the Nasa project "Parker Sun solar probe". As we targeted young we have to build something creative which will attract them. So we build a system that is identical to Parker and sun. Our system has 2 part the first part is prototype probe and sun , we use sensors to collect data like rotation ,speed form sun and show it through LCD display. And the 2nd part of our project is our app which collects the realtime data from probe and show it also it ask some question to engage the audience if they could answer correctly the app give them some points by which they can buy NASA premium stuff.

DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION

What is it?

We build a system to learn the young generation about the Nasa project "Parker Sun solar probe".

As we targeted young we have to build something creative which will attract them.

So we build a system that is identical to Parker and sun.

How does it work? Our system has 2 part the first part is prototype probe and sun , we use sensors to collect data like rotation ,speed form sun and show it through LCD display. And the 2nd part of our project is our app which collects the realtime data from probe and show it also it ask some question to engage the audience if they could answer correctly the app give them some points by which they can buy NASA premium stuff.

For building our prototype we use white board sheets and we use arduino uno for controlling stuff , we use an ultrasonic sensor 2 LCD display to show data of parker and a servo to rotate sun.

And for application we use an android emulator which connects to parker through Bluetooth and collect data and shows it.

What do we hope to achieve? Every year, billions of dollars are lost due to solar wind. So, we're attempting to inspire young people to demonstrate an interest in this field. Through our effort, we are thinking about educating 2.5 million young people about this system.

What tools, coding languages, hardware, or software did you use to develop we project?

We build our prototype with board , stand , arduino uno, sonar sensor , 2 LCD display , IOT chip , servo motor, breadboard. for app we use andoid emulator and we collect data to cloud and render it to our app that's how we manage request response .
